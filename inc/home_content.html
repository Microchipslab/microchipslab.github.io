<p>Hello, welcome to my small place on the internet.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress!</p>
<p>This is my first HTML5 website. I'm still in the process of learning HTML5 as well as PHP, MySQL and CSS. All
    you see here is made by hand by me, even the coding was done by my own hand, no WYSIWYG software was used and
    no template or ready made pages!</p>
